- My old website was [https://sites.google.com/site/abulhayatshiblu/ here] that I do not maintain after April 2018 anymore.
- `Md' in my first name corresponds to `Muhammad'. Using `Md' instead of `M(uhamma)d' is a common practice in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh Bangladesh]. To avoid these confusions, I prefer calling myself by my last name `Hayat'.
